Personal project to organize photos. It organizes photos by year, with an option to sort my cats into subfolders using AI. Very basic so far since it's mostly for personal use. Sort of like a "pet" project if you will. 

Get it? "pet"? Hahaha...

Future tasks:
  1) Tweak the AI to sort the cats better. Seems to miss a few.
  2) Progress bar?
  3) Set it so the Original folder also dives into sub folders looking for photos.
  4) For "unknown" files, make it an option to review ones that can be guess (ie in between two from the same year), maybe use AI?
